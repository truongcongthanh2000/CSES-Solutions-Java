It's similar with project I have made with C++ before, you can see at [here](https://github.com/truongcongthanh2000/CSES-Solutions). But in this project, all the code will write by Java.

In this project, I use [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091-chelper) to build code easier. This is an application that is used by many people in the competitive programming community.
